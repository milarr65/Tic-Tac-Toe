    GAMEPLAY:
    The layout of the game is a 3x3 grid, as usual.
    Each cell corresponds to a number.
                                    [1] [2] [3]
                                    [4] [5] [6]
                                    [7] [8] [9]
    To place your mark simply type the number of the cell you wish to fill.
    For example if you type "6" this is what you'd get:
                                    [] [] []
                                    [] [] [X]
                                    [] [] []
    RULES:                                
    You are X , your friend (or the computer if you chose single player mode) is O. 
    Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to 
    get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 
    When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

    To see all available commands type "-h"
